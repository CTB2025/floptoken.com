**FLOP Coin Whitepaper**

## **Abstract**
FLOP Coin is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC)-based meme coin that integrates an AI-powered prediction market. Users can engage by voting on AI-generated predictions using FLOP tokens, with correct voters earning FlopXP (FXP). A portion of losing bets is burned, while winnings fuel FLOP buybacks, enhancing scarcity and market sustainability. The system is designed to be scalable, with on-chain vote verification and efficient transaction batching.
